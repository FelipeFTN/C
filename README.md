# C & C++ Repository

This repository contains multiple C and C++ projects aimed at showcasing various concepts and applications of these programming languages. Each project is organized into separate directories for easy navigation. Below is an overview of each project available in this repository.

## Projects

### 1. Encoder

This project demonstrates the implementation of an encoder, which can encode and decode text using different algorithms or techniques.

### 2. GameDevelopment

In this project, you will find a game developed using C or C++. It showcases game development concepts, such as graphics rendering, input handling, and game logic.

### 3. HelloWorld

The HelloWorld project is a simple introductory program written in C or C++. It prints "Hello, World!" to the console, serving as a starting point for beginners.

### 4. Input

The Input project explores various methods of accepting and handling user input within a C or C++ program. It demonstrates different techniques like command-line arguments, file input/output, and interactive input from the user.

### 5. Login

The Login project focuses on implementing a basic login system using C or C++. It illustrates concepts like user authentication, password handling, and file/database storage.

### 6. ProceduralGeneration

In this project, you will find an example of procedural generation using C or C++. It demonstrates the generation of random or algorithmic content, such as terrain, mazes, or images.

### 7. Quiz

The Quiz project is a console-based program that presents a series of questions to the user and evaluates their answers. It showcases concepts like data structures, control flow, and user interaction.

### 8. Socket

The Socket project explores network programming using C or C++. It demonstrates how to establish socket connections, send and receive data over networks, and build client-server applications.

### 9. Challenges

The Challenges project contains a collection of coding challenges or exercises in C or C++. It offers opportunities to practice and improve your programming skills by solving various problems.

### 10. HTTPServer

Creating a simple http server using C++ & C (just like Javascript do at the backstage).
